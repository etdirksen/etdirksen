Hi, I’m @etdirksen

I’m interested in math and science! I recently finished taking a Bootcamp offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison to learn Data Analytics. I’m looking to collaborate on different Python projects in the near future.

For all professional inquiries, you can reach me at edirksen.work@gmail.com.
